Microcomputer,Directly affected as it is connected to the Camera module and will need to handle input from additional cameras.,Instead of 1 camera module we would use 3 to capture fruits images with 3 views,1
Detection algorithm,The Detection algorithm is directly connected to the Classification algorithm. Changes in the Classification algorithm's output format or content will likely require adjustments in how the Detection algorithm processes or uses this information.,"Classification algorithm would change, now it outputs the only the grade of each fruit,e.g. fresh or rotten.",1
Storage,"Storage is connected to the Classification algorithm. If the format or type of data being output by the Classification algorithm changes, the Storage system may need to be updated to accommodate these changes.","Classification algorithm would change, now it outputs the only the grade of each fruit,e.g. fresh or rotten.",1
