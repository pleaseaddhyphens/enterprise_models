1st level of change:

Component: Camera module
Reasoning: The Camera module would be directly affected as it would need to handle the increased data size and potentially require a higher resolution sensor to meet the new image quality standards.

2nd level of change:

Component: Microcomputer
Reasoning: The Microcomputer may need enhanced processing capabilities to handle the increased data load from the higher resolution images provided by the Camera module.

Component: Detection algorithm
Reasoning: The Detection algorithm might need adjustments to process higher resolution images, which could require more computational resources and potentially algorithm optimization.

Component: Classification algorithm
Reasoning: The Classification algorithm may also be impacted as it could need to handle more detailed image data, potentially requiring more processing power and memory.

Component: Storage
Reasoning: Storage requirements would increase due to the larger image sizes, necessitating greater storage capacity and potentially faster storage solutions to handle the increased data throughput.

Component: Power sub-system
Reasoning: The Power sub-system might need to supply additional power to support the enhanced processing and storage requirements.

Final Output:
