1st level of change:

Detection algorithm: This component is directly involved in the image processing tasks and will need adjustments to detect and analyze tomatoes instead of tangerines.
Classification algorithm: This component works in tandem with the detection algorithm and will need to be updated to classify tomatoes correctly.

2nd level of change:

Microcomputer: Connected to both the Detection and Classification algorithms, the microcomputer may need updates to handle the new data processing requirements for tomatoes.
Storage: Connected to the Classification algorithm, storage requirements or data handling processes might need adjustments based on the new type of data being processed.
Camera module: Since the camera is connected to the microcomputer and is responsible for capturing images, it may need adjustments to optimize image capture for tomatoes.
Lighting module: Connected to the microcomputer, changes in lighting might be necessary to ensure optimal imaging conditions for tomatoes.
Power sub-system: Connected to multiple components including the microcomputer and lighting module, power requirements might change with the new processing demands.
