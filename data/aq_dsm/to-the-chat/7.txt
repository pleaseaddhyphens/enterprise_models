Based on the change request to use 3 camera modules instead of 1, the components in the system that could be influenced by that change are:

1st Level of Change:
Camera module: Directly affected as the number of units increases from 1 to 3.
Structure: Directly affected as it is connected to the Camera module and will need to accommodate additional camera modules.
Microcomputer: Directly affected as it is connected to the Camera module and will need to handle input from additional cameras.
2nd Level of Change:
Lighting module: Could be affected due to changes in the Structure to accommodate additional cameras, potentially altering lighting requirements.
Control panel: Could be affected due to changes in the Microcomputer handling additional inputs, potentially requiring adjustments in control mechanisms.
Power sub-system: Could be affected due to increased power requirements for additional Camera modules and potential changes in Microcomputer and Structure.
Final Output:
