1st level of change:

Component: Belt sub-system
Reasoning: The Belt sub-system would be directly affected as it would be replaced by a roller conveyor system, necessitating changes in mechanical structure and control mechanisms.

2nd level of change:

Component: Structure
Reasoning: The Structure may need modifications to accommodate the new roller conveyor system, potentially requiring adjustments in design and assembly to support the new mechanism.

Component: Power sub-system
Reasoning: The Power sub-system might need adjustments to cater to the different power requirements of the roller conveyor compared to the belt system.

Component: Microcomputer
Reasoning: The Microcomputer may require updates in its control algorithms or software to manage the operation of the roller conveyor system effectively.

Component: Control panel
Reasoning: The Control panel might need updates to its interface and control logic to accommodate the new operational parameters and user interactions related to the roller conveyor.

Final Output:
