### Phase 1: Identify Impact

The change "The device shall be water-resistant up to 50 meters" will directly influence the following components:

1. **Aluminium housing**
   - Reasoning: The housing must be sealed and robust to withstand water pressure.

2. **Watch strap**
   - Reasoning: The strap must be made of a material that is water-resistant.

3. **Side buttons**
   - Reasoning: Buttons need to be sealed to prevent water ingress.

4. **PCB (Printed Circuit Board)**
   - Reasoning: The PCB must be coated or designed to prevent water damage.

5. **Wireless charger**
   - Reasoning: The charging mechanism must be designed to prevent water ingress.

6. **Speaker**
   - Reasoning: Speaker design must prevent water from entering and damaging internal components.

7. **Microphone**
   - Reasoning: Microphone design must prevent water from entering and damaging internal components.

### Phase 2: Self-Evaluation and Verification

- **Aluminium housing**: Must be sealed and robust for water resistance.
- **Watch strap**: Needs water-resistant material for durability.
- **Side buttons**: Require sealing to prevent water ingress.
- **PCB**: Needs waterproof coating or design to avoid damage.
- **Wireless charger**: Must prevent water ingress during charging.
- **Speaker**: Design must prevent water entry and damage.
- **Microphone**: Design must prevent water entry and damage.

Each identified component logically requires modification to ensure water resistance up to 50 meters.
