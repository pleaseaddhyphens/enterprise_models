### Phase 1: Identify Impact

1. **Software Application**
   - **Reasoning**: It will need to handle the processing of physiological data directly on the smartphone, which was previously handled elsewhere.

2. **Computing Unit**
   - **Reasoning**: It will need to send raw physiological data to the smartphone for processing instead of processing it locally.

3. **Data Storage and Processing Server**
   - **Reasoning**: It will no longer receive raw physiological data for processing, only anonymized or processed data.

### Phase 2: Self-Evaluation and Verification

1. **Software Application**
   - **Consistency Check**: Directly processes data; consistent with architecture.

2. **Computing Unit**
   - **Consistency Check**: Sends raw data; aligns with new processing location.

3. **Data Storage and Processing Server**
   - **Consistency Check**: Receives processed data; matches privacy requirements.
