### Phase 1: Identify Impact

The incoming change is: "Charging time shall be reduced from 3 hours to 1 hour (for charging from 0% to 80%)."

Let's identify the components that are directly influenced by this change:

1. **Wireless Charger**
   - Reasoning: The wireless charger is directly responsible for charging the device. Reducing the charging time will require modifications to the wireless charger to support faster charging.

2. **Battery**
   - Reasoning: The battery is the component being charged. Changes in charging time may necessitate modifications to the battery technology or capacity to handle faster charging without adverse effects.

3. **PMIC (Power Management Integrated Circuit)**
   - Reasoning: The PMIC manages the power flow to the battery. It will need adjustments to handle the increased power delivery required for faster charging.

### Phase 2: Self-Evaluation and Verification

- **Wireless Charger**
  - Verification: Directly manages charging; needs upgrade for faster charging.

- **Battery**
  - Verification: Must support faster charging without degradation.

- **PMIC**
  - Verification: Controls power flow; requires adjustment for faster charging.
