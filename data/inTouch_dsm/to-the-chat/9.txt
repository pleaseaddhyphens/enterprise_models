### Phase 1: Identify Impact

1. **Wireless Charger**
   - **Reasoning**: The change explicitly states that wireless charging will be replaced by a wired solution, directly impacting the wireless charger component.

2. **Power Management**
   - **Reasoning**: The power management subsystem will need to accommodate the new wired charging solution, impacting its design or configuration.

3. **Battery**
   - **Reasoning**: The battery may need adjustments to be compatible with the new wired charging method.

4. **Aluminium Housing**
   - **Reasoning**: The physical design of the housing may need to be altered to include a port for wired charging.

5. **Structural Support**
   - **Reasoning**: The overall structural design might need to be reassessed to integrate the new wired charging port.

### Phase 2: Self-Evaluation and Verification

- **Wireless Charger**: Directly replaced by the change.
- **Power Management**: Needs to manage wired charging.
- **Battery**: Must be compatible with wired charging.
- **Aluminium Housing**: Requires modification for charging port.
- **Structural Support**: Needs to support new charging method.
