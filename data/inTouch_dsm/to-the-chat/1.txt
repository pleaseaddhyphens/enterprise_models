### Phase 1: Identify Impact

1. **Component: Battery**
   - **Reasoning:** The primary component responsible for power storage; increasing battery life directly affects it.

2. **Component: PMIC (Power Management Integrated Circuit)**
   - **Reasoning:** Manages power distribution and consumption; needs adjustment for extended battery life.

3. **Component: Wireless Charger**
   - **Reasoning:** Charging mechanism may need modification to support new battery specifications.

### Phase 2: Self-Evaluation and Verification

1. **Component: Battery**
   - **Verification:** Directly stores power; needs capacity increase for longer life.

2. **Component: PMIC**
   - **Verification:** Manages power; must optimize for new battery capacity.

3. **Component: Wireless Charger**
   - **Verification:** Charges battery; must adapt to new battery requirements.
