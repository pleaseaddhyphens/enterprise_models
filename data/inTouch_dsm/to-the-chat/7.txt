### Phase 1: Identify Impact

1. **Structural Support**
   - **Reasoning**: Adding an OLED display will require modifications to the housing and possibly the strap to accommodate the new component.

2. **Aluminium Housing**
   - **Reasoning**: The housing will need to be redesigned to fit and protect the OLED display.

3. **Watch Strap**
   - **Reasoning**: The strap might need adjustments to support the additional weight and size of the OLED display.

4. **Power Management**
   - **Reasoning**: An OLED display will consume additional power, necessitating changes in power management.

5. **Battery**
   - **Reasoning**: The battery might need to be upgraded or modified to handle the increased power consumption.

6. **PCB (Printed Circuit Board)**
   - **Reasoning**: The PCB will need to be redesigned to integrate the OLED display connections and possibly additional components.

### Phase 2: Self-Evaluation and Verification

1. **Structural Support**
   - **Consistency**: Directly impacted as it encompasses housing and strap modifications.

2. **Aluminium Housing**
   - **Consistency**: Directly impacted due to physical integration of the display.

3. **Watch Strap**
   - **Consistency**: Directly impacted to support new physical characteristics.

4. **Power Management**
   - **Consistency**: Directly impacted due to increased power requirements.

5. **Battery**
   - **Consistency**: Directly impacted to meet new power demands.

6. **PCB**
   - **Consistency**: Directly impacted to accommodate new electronic connections.
