### Phase 1: Identify Impact

The components that are directly influenced by the change "The total device weight shall be reduced from 60 grams to 36 grams" are:

1. **Aluminium housing**
   - Reasoning: The housing material and design will need to be modified to reduce weight.

2. **Battery**
   - Reasoning: The battery is often one of the heaviest components and will need to be lighter.

3. **Watch strap**
   - Reasoning: The strap material and design may need to be adjusted for weight reduction.

4. **PCB**
   - Reasoning: The PCB design might need optimization to reduce size and weight.

5. **Wireless charger**
   - Reasoning: The wireless charging components may need to be made lighter.

6. **Speaker**
   - Reasoning: The speaker components may need to be reduced in size or weight.

7. **Microphone**
   - Reasoning: The microphone components may need to be reduced in size or weight.

### Phase 2: Self-evaluation and Verification

- **Aluminium housing**: Weight reduction often involves changing the material or design.
- **Battery**: Lighter batteries are essential for reducing overall device weight.
- **Watch strap**: Straps can be redesigned with lighter materials.
- **PCB**: PCB optimization can contribute to weight reduction.
- **Wireless charger**: Lighter components are necessary for overall weight reduction.
- **Speaker**: Smaller or lighter speakers can help reduce weight.
- **Microphone**: Smaller or lighter microphones can help reduce weight.
