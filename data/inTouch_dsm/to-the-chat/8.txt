### Phase 1: Identify Impact

1. **Structural support**
   - **Reasoning**: Adding a haptic feedback motor will require modifications to the physical structure to accommodate the new component.

2. **PCB (Printed Circuit Board)**
   - **Reasoning**: The PCB will need to be redesigned to integrate the new haptic feedback motor.

3. **Power management**
   - **Reasoning**: Additional power consumption by the haptic motor necessitates adjustments in power management.

4. **Computing unit**
   - **Reasoning**: The computing unit will need to control the haptic feedback motor.

5. **Software application**
   - **Reasoning**: The software will need updates to manage haptic feedback alerts and guided breathing.

### Phase 2: Self-Evaluation and Verification

1. **Structural support**
   - **Consistency**: Direct physical integration required for new motor.

2. **PCB**
   - **Consistency**: PCB redesign needed for new electronic component.

3. **Power management**
   - **Consistency**: New component requires additional power management adjustments.

4. **Computing unit**
   - **Consistency**: Controls and manages new haptic feedback functionality.

5. **Software application**
   - **Consistency**: Software must manage new haptic feedback alerts.
