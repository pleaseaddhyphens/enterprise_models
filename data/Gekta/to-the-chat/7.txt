To conduct an impact analysis of the change request "Proper lighting conditions must be provided by the system itself," we need to identify the components that will be directly and indirectly affected by this change.

### 1st Level of Change:
1. **Component: Gekta**
   - **Reasoning:** The Gekta system is directly connected to the laboratory and is responsible for placing electricity, LAN connection, and ambient light. Since the change request involves lighting conditions, Gekta will need to incorporate a lighting subsystem to ensure proper lighting for the RPR reactions.

2. **Component: Laboratory**
   - **Reasoning:** The laboratory is the environment where the Gekta system operates. Since the lighting condition change is related to the environment, the laboratory setup will need to be adjusted to accommodate the new lighting subsystem provided by Gekta.

3. **Component: Camera for macro imaging**
   - **Reasoning:** Proper lighting conditions are crucial for capturing accurate images. The camera for macro imaging will be directly affected as it relies on good lighting to capture sediment images for analysis.

### 2nd Level of Change:
1. **Component: Railings**
   - **Reasoning:** The railings hold the position of the samples bed and are connected to the camera for macro imaging. Changes in lighting might require adjustments in how samples are positioned or how images are captured.

2. **Component: Software (specifically RPR reaction analyzer)**
   - **Reasoning:** The software, particularly the RPR reaction analyzer, relies on images captured by the camera. Changes in lighting conditions might necessitate updates to the computer vision algorithms to adapt to new lighting conditions.

3. **Component: Hardware (specifically CNC base frame and Pump)**
   - **Reasoning:** While not directly related to lighting, changes in the overall system setup (like adding new lighting components) might require adjustments in the physical layout or operational parameters of the CNC base frame and pump.
