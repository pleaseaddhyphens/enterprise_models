To conduct an impact analysis of the change request regarding the increased reliability requirement from 5000 hours to 10000 hours, we need to identify the components that are most likely to be affected by this change.

### 1st Level of Change:
1. **Component: Hardware**
   - **Reasoning:** The hardware, particularly the CNC base frame and pump, will need to be reassessed for durability and reliability. Increased operational hours will likely require more robust materials and potentially more frequent maintenance.

2. **Component: Pump**
   - **Reasoning:** As a high-precision component, the pump will need to ensure consistent performance over a longer period. This might require enhancements in material quality, lubrication, or cooling mechanisms.

3. **Component: CNC base frame**
   - **Reasoning:** The CNC base frame, responsible for precise movements, will need to maintain accuracy over a longer duration. This could necessitate improvements in mechanical parts and possibly enhanced calibration routines.

4. **Component: Alarm sub-system**
   - **Reasoning:** With increased operational hours, the alarm system may need to be more robust to ensure it can reliably alert personnel over a longer period without failure.

### 2nd Level of Change:
1. **Component: Software**
   - **Reasoning:** Software controlling the hardware may need updates to manage longer operational cycles, potentially requiring more robust error handling and system monitoring features.

2. **Component: Microcomputer**
   - **Reasoning:** The microcomputer may need to handle prolonged operations, necessitating potential upgrades in processing power or cooling systems to prevent overheating and ensure reliability.

3. **Component: Maintenance personnel**
   - **Reasoning:** Increased reliability requirements may necessitate changes in maintenance schedules, training, or procedures to ensure the system remains operational for longer periods.

4. **Component: Laboratory local net**
   - **Reasoning:** The local network may need to handle increased data flow and more consistent uptime, potentially requiring infrastructure upgrades.
