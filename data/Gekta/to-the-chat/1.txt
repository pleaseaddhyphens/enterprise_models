To conduct an impact analysis of the change request regarding the increased pipetting precision from 0.1 microliter to 0.05 microliters, we need to identify the components that could be influenced by this change. Let's break down the analysis into two levels:

### 1st Level of Change (Directly Affected Components):

1. **Component: Pump**
   - **Reasoning:** The pump is responsible for mixing the components of the PRP reaction with high precision. An increase in pipetting precision directly affects the pump's operation and its ability to handle smaller volumes accurately.

2. **Component: CNC and pump control algorithm**
   - **Reasoning:** The control algorithm for the CNC and pump will need adjustments to accommodate the new precision requirements. The algorithm must ensure that the pump operates correctly with the increased precision.

3. **Component: CNC base frame**
   - **Reasoning:** The CNC base frame moves the pipette, and with increased precision requirements, the mechanical movements and positioning accuracy of the CNC base frame may need to be reevaluated to ensure it can handle the finer control needed for 0.05 microliter precision.

### 2nd Level of Change (Indirectly Affected Components):

1. **Component: Software**
   - **Reasoning:** The software controls the CNC unit and analyzes reaction results. Changes in the pump and control algorithm may require updates to the software to ensure it can correctly interpret and manage the new precision levels.

2. **Component: G-code generator from path defined**
   - **Reasoning:** The G-code generator creates machine commands based on user input. With the increased precision, the G-code may need to be more detailed and accurate, requiring updates to the generator.

3. **Component: Interfaces and user interaction**
   - **Reasoning:** The user interface may need updates to allow users to input and manage the more precise pipetting paths and parameters.

4. **Component: RPR reaction analyzer**
   - **Reasoning:** The analyzer uses computer vision to analyze reaction results. With higher precision in pipetting, the analyzer may need adjustments to correctly interpret the results of more precise reactions.

5. **Component: Microcomputer**
   - **Reasoning:** The microcomputer provides computing power for control routing and interfacing. Increased precision may require additional computational resources or updates to handle the more detailed control commands.

6. **Component: Screen for interaction with the system**
   - **Reasoning:** The interaction screen may need updates to display the more precise control options and results to the user.

7. **Component: Alarm sub-system**
   - **Reasoning:** The alarm system may need adjustments to correctly identify and alert for issues related to the new precision levels.
