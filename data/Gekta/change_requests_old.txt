The pipetting precision has been increased from 0.1 microliter to 0.05 microliters.
The microplate size has been changed from 130x80x60 to 120x95x80.
The required analysis time for one sample has been decreased from a maximum of 5 seconds to 3 seconds.
The required reliability has been increased from 5000 hours to 10000 hours.
The microplate well volume has been changed from 400 to 600 micorliters.
The required accuracy of automated reaction product detection has been changed from 90% to 95%.
Proper lighting conditions must be provided by the system itself.
The volume of the experiment varies from 40 microliters to 15 microliters
Add a barcode reader to identify the reaction product in the system
To determine the reaction product, use a refractometer sensor instead of computer vision.
