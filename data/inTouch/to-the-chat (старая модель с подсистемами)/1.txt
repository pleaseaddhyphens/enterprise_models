To analyze the impact of increasing the battery life from 1 day to 7 days, we need to consider the components that are directly and indirectly affected by this change. Here's the breakdown:

### 1st Level of Change:
1. **Component: Battery**
   - **Reasoning:** The primary component directly affected by the change in battery life. The battery will need to have a higher capacity or improved efficiency to last longer.

2. **Component: Power management**
   - **Reasoning:** The power management system will need to be optimized to handle the increased battery capacity and ensure efficient power usage across the device.

3. **Component: PMIC (Power Management Integrated Circuit)**
   - **Reasoning:** The PMIC will need to be adjusted or upgraded to manage the new power requirements and ensure efficient charging and discharging of the battery.

4. **Component: Wireless charger**
   - **Reasoning:** The wireless charger may need modifications to handle the new battery specifications, such as charging time and efficiency.

### 2nd Level of Change:
1. **Component: Structural support**
   - **Reasoning:** A larger battery might require changes in the structural design to accommodate the increased size or weight of the battery.

2. **Component: Aluminium housing**
   - **Reasoning:** The housing may need to be redesigned to fit the new battery size and ensure the device remains wearable and comfortable.

3. **Component: PCB (Printed Circuit Board)**
   - **Reasoning:** The PCB layout might need adjustments to accommodate changes in the power management system and battery connections.

4. **Component: Software application**
   - **Reasoning:** The software may need updates to optimize power consumption and manage the new battery life effectively, including providing accurate battery life indicators to the user.
