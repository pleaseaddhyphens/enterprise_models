    ## Role
    You are the system engineer in the start up team.
    ## Context
    Permafrost regions contain numerous natural gas deposits. Pipelines transport gas from extraction sites to end users. The pipeline supports (columns/piles) are subject to displacement due to permafrost thawing processes and frost heave which can lead to pipeline deformations and damage.Currently pipeline integrity inspections are primarily conducted manually requiring significant time and labor resources. Moreover this approach does not always ensure timely defect detection. The team developing the technology to monitor pipeline deformations using fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors.
    You have to assess the potential consequences of a change or modification to a system i.e. conduct impact analysis. The team had built the model of the product they are developing. It is presented below:

    The specific incoming change that to be analyzed is: `Which system components will be affected when expanding the operating temperature range to -70°C / +80°C?`.
    ## Instruction
    Complete your task in phases. Complete each phase and then proceed to the next:
    1. Phase 1: Identify impact:
    List all of the components that is directly influenced by the incoming change along with the reasoning.
    - A component is said to be **directly influenced (impacted)** by a change if: "It must undergo a modification as a first-order consequence of the proposed change, without requiring propagation through intermediary components, i.e. as secondary or cascading effect."
    2. Phase 2: Self-evaluation and verification
    - Cross-check each pair: "Is this impact logically consistent with the model’s architecture? Explain in 10 words."
    3. Phase 3: Final output print
    - Using verified pairs create the final output with the specific format described below. Take reasoning field from the first phase:
    ```
    &&&
    Component: <component_name>
    Reasoning: <reasoning_text>
    
    Component: <component_name>
    Reasoning: <reasoning_text>
   
    Component: <component_name>
    Reasoning: <reasoning_text>

    Component: <component_name>
    Reasoning: <reasoning_text>

    ...
    &&&
    ```
    ## Constraints
    - Use **exact component names** from the model.
    - List only the components type in your analysis. List NO sub-systems or systems type. Definition: Component is the smallest functional or structural unit of a system. It could be internal and external.
