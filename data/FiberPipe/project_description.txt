Permafrost regions contain numerous natural gas deposits. Pipelines transport gas from extraction sites to end users. The pipeline supports (columns/piles) are subject to displacement due to permafrost thawing processes and frost heave which can lead to pipeline deformations and damage.Currently pipeline integrity inspections are primarily conducted manually requiring significant time and labor resources. Moreover this approach does not always ensure timely defect detection. The team developing the technology to monitor pipeline deformations using fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors.
