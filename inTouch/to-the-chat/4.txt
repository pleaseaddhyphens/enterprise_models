Based on the change request that all physiological data processing should be performed on the owner's smartphone for privacy purposes, here is the analysis:

### 1st Level of Change:
1. **Component: Software application**
   - **Reasoning:** The software application currently handles the recognition of the user's physiological and emotional state based on data. It will need to be updated to process all physiological data locally on the smartphone.

2. **Component: Data storage and processing server**
   - **Reasoning:** The server currently updates and fine-tunes the emotion recognition model based on user insights. With the change, it will no longer receive physiological data for processing, thus its interaction with the software application will be limited to model updates only.

3. **Component: Computing unit**
   - **Reasoning:** The computing unit, which currently preprocesses sensor data, may need to send raw or minimally processed data directly to the smartphone for full processing.

### 2nd Level of Change:
1. **Component: Sensors**
   - **Reasoning:** If the computing unit changes how it processes data, the sensors might need adjustments to ensure they are providing data in a format suitable for direct transmission to the smartphone.

2. **Component: Communication (Bluetooth)**
   - **Reasoning:** The communication subsystem, particularly Bluetooth, may need enhancements to handle increased data transmission to the smartphone.

3. **Component: Power management**
   - **Reasoning:** Increased local processing on the smartphone and potentially more data transmission could impact power consumption, necessitating a review of power management strategies.

4. **Component: Owners Smartphone**
   - **Reasoning:** The smartphone will now handle more intensive data processing tasks, which could require software updates and potentially impact performance and battery life.
