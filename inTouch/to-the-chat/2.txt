To conduct an impact analysis of the change request "The device shall be water-resistant up to 50 meters," we need to identify the components that could be influenced by this change. Let's break down the analysis into two levels:

### 1st Level of Change
These components are directly affected by the need for water resistance:

1. **Component: Structural support**
   - **Reasoning:** The structural support, including the Aluminium housing, Watch strap, and Side buttons, will need to be designed to prevent water ingress. Seals and gaskets may need to be added or improved to ensure water resistance.

2. **Component: PCB (Printed Circuit Board)**
   - **Reasoning:** The PCB will need to be coated or otherwise protected to prevent water damage. This might involve conformal coating or potting to ensure that water does not cause short circuits or corrosion.

3. **Component: Sensors (PPG sensors, IMU)**
   - **Reasoning:** Sensors will need to be sealed to prevent water ingress, which could interfere with their operation or cause damage. This might involve using waterproof casings or sealants.

4. **Component: Communication (Bluetooth, GPS)**
   - **Reasoning:** Communication components will need to be protected from water, which could interfere with signal transmission or cause damage. This might involve sealing the components or using waterproof materials.

5. **Component: Power management (PMIC, Battery, Wireless charger)**
   - **Reasoning:** Power management components will need to be sealed to prevent water ingress, which could cause short circuits or corrosion. This might involve using waterproof casings or sealants.

6. **Component: Audio sub-system (Speaker, Microphone)**
   - **Reasoning:** Audio components will need to be designed to prevent water ingress, which could interfere with their operation or cause damage. This might involve using waterproof membranes or sealants.

### 2nd Level of Change
These components are affected by changes in the 1st level components:

1. **Component: EmotionBand**
   - **Reasoning:** As the main system, the overall design and integration of the EmotionBand will need to account for the water resistance requirements of its sub-components.

2. **Component: Software application**
   - **Reasoning:** While the software itself is not directly affected by water resistance, any changes in hardware (like additional seals or coatings) might require updates to ensure compatibility and proper functioning.

3. **Component: Data storage and processing server**
   - **Reasoning:** Indirectly affected if changes in data transmission or processing are needed due to modifications in the hardware components.

4. **Component: Owners Smartphone**
   - **Reasoning:** Indirectly affected if there are changes in how data is transmitted from the EmotionBand to the smartphone due to water resistance modifications.
