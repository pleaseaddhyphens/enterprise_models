To conduct an impact analysis of adding an OLED display to the EmotionBand system, we need to identify the components that could be directly and indirectly affected by this change. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### 1st Level of Change (Directly Affected Components):

1. **Component: Structural Support**
   - **Reasoning:** The addition of an OLED display will require changes to the structural design to accommodate the new display. This includes modifications to the Aluminium housing, Watch strap, and possibly the Side buttons to ensure the display fits and is accessible.

2. **Component: Power Management**
   - **Reasoning:** An OLED display will consume additional power, necessitating changes in the power management subsystem. This includes the Battery, PMIC (Power Management Integrated Circuit), and potentially the Wireless charger to ensure adequate power supply and charging capabilities.

3. **Component: PCB (Printed Circuit Board)**
   - **Reasoning:** The PCB will need to be redesigned to integrate the OLED display, including new connections and possibly additional components to support the display functionality.

4. **Component: Computing Unit**
   - **Reasoning:** The Computing Unit, which includes the MCU (Micro Controller Unit) and Memory, will need to handle additional data processing tasks related to driving the OLED display and managing its content.

### 2nd Level of Change (Indirectly Affected Components):

1. **Component: Software Application**
   - **Reasoning:** The software will need updates to manage and control the OLED display, including displaying notifications, statistics, and other user interface elements.

2. **Component: Communication**
   - **Reasoning:** If the display is used to show information related to Bluetooth or GPS functionality, the communication subsystem might need updates to ensure seamless integration and user experience.

3. **Component: Audio Sub-system**
   - **Reasoning:** If the display is used in conjunction with audio feedback (e.g., visualizing sound levels or audio notifications), the audio sub-system might need adjustments to synchronize with the display.
