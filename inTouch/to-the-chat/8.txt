To conduct an impact analysis of the change request to add a "Haptic feedback motor" for real-time emotional state alerts or guided breathing, we need to identify the components that could be influenced by this change. We'll start by identifying the components directly affected by this change (1st level of change) and then identify components affected by changes in the first set (2nd level of change).

### 1st Level of Change:
1. **Component: Structural support**
   - **Reasoning:** The addition of a haptic feedback motor will require physical space and structural integration within the device. The structural support system, which includes the Aluminium housing, Watch strap, and Side buttons, will need to accommodate this new component.

2. **Component: Power management**
   - **Reasoning:** The haptic feedback motor will require power to operate. The Power management subsystem, which includes the PMIC, Battery, and Wireless charger, will need to supply power to this new component.

3. **Component: PCB (Printed Circuit Board)**
   - **Reasoning:** The haptic feedback motor will need to be connected to the PCB for electrical connectivity and integration with other electronic components.

4. **Component: Computing unit**
   - **Reasoning:** The haptic feedback motor will need to be controlled by the Computing unit, which includes the MCU and Memory. The MCU will need to send signals to the motor based on the emotional state data processed.

5. **Component: Software application**
   - **Reasoning:** The software will need to be updated to include control logic for the haptic feedback motor, determining when and how to activate it based on the user's emotional state.

### 2nd Level of Change:
1. **Component: EmotionBand**
   - **Reasoning:** As the main system, any changes to its subsystems or components will affect the overall design and functionality of the EmotionBand.

2. **Component: Sensors**
   - **Reasoning:** If the Computing unit or Software application requires additional data or different processing due to the haptic feedback, the Sensors subsystem might need adjustments to provide the necessary data.

3. **Component: Communication**
   - **Reasoning:** If the haptic feedback requires additional data or commands from the smartphone or server, the Communication subsystem (Bluetooth, GPS) might need updates.

4. **Component: Audio sub-system**
   - **Reasoning:** If the haptic feedback is part of a broader alert system that includes audio alerts, the Audio sub-system (Speaker, Microphone) might need to be integrated with the new feedback mechanism.
