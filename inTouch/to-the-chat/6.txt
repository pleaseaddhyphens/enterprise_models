To conduct an impact analysis of the change request to integrate an Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensor into the EmotionBand system, we need to identify the components that will be directly and indirectly affected by this change.

### 1st Level of Change (Directly Affected Components):

1. **Component: Sensors**
   - **Reasoning:** The EDA sensor will be part of the Sensors subsystem, as it is responsible for measuring physiological parameters.

2. **Component: Computing Unit**
   - **Reasoning:** The Computing Unit will need to handle the additional data from the EDA sensor, requiring potential updates to data processing algorithms.

3. **Component: Software Application**
   - **Reasoning:** The Software Application will need to incorporate the new data from the EDA sensor to improve emotion and stress detection algorithms.

4. **Component: PCB (Printed Circuit Board)**
   - **Reasoning:** The PCB will need to accommodate the new EDA sensor, potentially requiring a redesign to include additional connections and components.

### 2nd Level of Change (Indirectly Affected Components):

1. **Component: MCU (Micro Controller Unit)**
   - **Reasoning:** The MCU, as part of the Computing Unit, may need updates to handle the preprocessing of additional sensor data from the EDA sensor.

2. **Component: Memory**
   - **Reasoning:** Additional sensor data may require more storage, impacting the Memory component in terms of capacity and data management.

3. **Component: Communication (Bluetooth)**
   - **Reasoning:** Increased data from the EDA sensor may require more bandwidth or changes in data transmission protocols.

4. **Component: Power Management**
   - **Reasoning:** The addition of the EDA sensor may increase power consumption, necessitating adjustments in the Power Management subsystem.

5. **Component: Data Storage and Processing Server**
   - **Reasoning:** The server will need to handle additional data from the EDA sensor for updates and fine-tuning of emotion recognition models.
