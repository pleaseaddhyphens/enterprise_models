    The change request:`Battery life shall be increased from 1 day to 7 days.`. List the components in the system that could be influenced by that change with the reasoning. Please, be specific! Please, in case sub-system owns components, provide only the components without sub-system. Please, leave the names of the componetns as they presented in the model. Please, provide at first the components that directly affected by that change, and then components affected by the change of the first set. So, in the intermediate answer I expect 1st level of change and then 2nd level of change caused by 1st level changes. After that provide the final output with format provided in Final Output Example with ONLY 1st level of changes
    Final Output Example:
    &&&
    Component: <component_name>  
    Reasoning: <reasoning_text>  

    Component: <component_name>  
    Reasoning: <reasoning_text>  
    &&&
    Provide no other text that required by your task.
