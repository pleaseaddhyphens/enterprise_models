To conduct an impact analysis of the change request to reduce the total device weight from 60 grams to 36 grams, we need to identify the components that could be directly influenced by this change and then determine the subsequent effects on other components.

### 1st Level of Change:
1. **Component: Structural support**
   - **Reasoning:** The structural support includes the Aluminium housing, Watch strap, and Side buttons. Reducing the weight will likely require redesigning or using lighter materials for these parts.

2. **Component: Battery**
   - **Reasoning:** The battery is a significant contributor to the weight of electronic devices. Reducing the weight may necessitate finding a lighter battery or reducing its capacity.

3. **Component: PCB (Printed Circuit Board)**
   - **Reasoning:** The PCB supports all electronic components. Reducing its size or using lighter materials can contribute to weight reduction.

4. **Component: Power management**
   - **Reasoning:** This includes the PMIC, Battery, and Wireless charger. Changes in the battery and overall power management strategy might be needed to reduce weight.

5. **Component: Aluminium housing**
   - **Reasoning:** As part of the structural support, the housing material and design might need to be altered to reduce weight.

6. **Component: Watch strap**
   - **Reasoning:** The strap material might need to be changed to a lighter alternative to contribute to the overall weight reduction.

### 2nd Level of Change:
1. **Component: Sensors**
   - **Reasoning:** If the structural support or PCB changes, the placement and integration of sensors might need to be reconsidered.

2. **Component: Communication**
   - **Reasoning:** Changes in the PCB or power management might affect the communication components like Bluetooth and GPS.

3. **Component: Computing unit**
   - **Reasoning:** Any changes in the PCB or power management could impact the computing unit, which includes the MCU and Memory.

4. **Component: Audio sub-system**
   - **Reasoning:** Changes in structural components or PCB might affect the integration of the speaker and microphone.
