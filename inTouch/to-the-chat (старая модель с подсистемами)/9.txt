To conduct an impact analysis of the change request, we need to identify the components that will be directly and indirectly affected by replacing the wireless charging solution with a wired charging solution.

### 1st Level of Change:
1. **Component: Wireless charger**
   - **Reasoning:** This component will be directly replaced by a wired charging solution.

2. **Component: Power management**
   - **Reasoning:** The power management subsystem will need to accommodate the new wired charging method, potentially requiring changes in how power is managed and distributed.

3. **Component: Structural support**
   - **Reasoning:** The structural design, particularly the housing and possibly the watch strap, may need modifications to integrate a wired charging port.

### 2nd Level of Change:
1. **Component: Aluminium housing**
   - **Reasoning:** Modifications to the housing may be required to include a wired charging port, affecting the overall design and potentially the materials used.

2. **Component: Watch strap**
   - **Reasoning:** The watch strap design might need adjustments to accommodate the new wired charging mechanism, especially if the charging port is located near the strap.

3. **Component: PCB (Printed Circuit Board)**
   - **Reasoning:** The PCB may need to be redesigned to integrate the new wired charging solution, affecting the layout and connections of electronic components.

4. **Component: Battery**
   - **Reasoning:** Changes in charging methods could impact battery management and charging circuits, requiring potential updates to how the battery interfaces with the charging system.
