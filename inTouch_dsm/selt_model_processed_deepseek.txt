### **System Overview**  
**Description:** A wearable watch-like device that identifies human emotions from sensor data. It collects physiological and motion data, processes it, and provides feedback to the user via notifications. Data is also shared with a server for model improvements.

### **Components of the EmotionBand System**  

#### **1. Sensors (Sub-system)**  
- **PPG Sensor:** Measures changes in blood volume in tissue using photoplethysmography.  
- **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):** Tracks body motion and orientation.  

#### **2. Computing Unit (Sub-system)**  
- **MCU (Microcontroller Unit):** Collects and preprocesses sensor data; communicates with the smartphone.  
- **Memory:** Includes RAM and Flash for data storage and processing.  

#### **3. Communication (Sub-system)**  
- **Bluetooth:** Enables wireless communication with the smartphone.  
- **GPS:** Provides location tracking (if applicable).  

#### **4. Power Management (Sub-system)**  
- **PMIC (Power Management Integrated Circuit):** Manages power distribution.  
- **Battery:** Supplies power to the device.  
- **Wireless Charger:** Enables charging without physical connectors.  

#### **5. Structural Support (Sub-system)**  
- **Aluminium Housing:** Protective casing for internal components.  
- **Watch Strap:** Secures the device to the user’s wrist.  
- **Side Buttons:** Physical controls for user input.  

#### **6. Audio Sub-system (Sub-system)**  
- **Speaker:** Outputs audio feedback (e.g., notifications).  
- **Microphone:** Captures voice input (if applicable).  

#### **7. PCB (Component)**  
- **Printed Circuit Board:** Interconnects and supports all electronic components.  

#### **8. Software Application (Component)**  
- Runs on the **Owner’s Smartphone** (external).  
- Functions:  
  - Recognizes emotional states from sensor data.  
  - Sends anonymized data to the server.  
  - Receives model/software updates from the server.  
  - Provides user notifications (e.g., "You seem stressed. Take a break").

### **External Components**  
1. **Band User**  
   - The human wearing the EmotionBand.  
2. **Owner’s Smartphone**  
   - Acts as a hub for data transfer between the EmotionBand and the server.  
3. **Data Storage and Processing Server**  
   - Stores anonymized user data.  
   - Updates the emotion recognition model based on aggregated insights.

### **Flows (Connections)**  

#### **Internal Flows (within EmotionBand)**  
1. **Sensors → Computing Unit**  
   - *Flow:* Measured physical parameters (e.g., heart rate, motion data).  
2. **Computing Unit → Software Application (on Smartphone)**  
   - *Flow:* Physical data measured.  
3. **Software Application → Computing Unit**  
   - *Flow:* Notifications and feedback (e.g., stress alerts).  

#### **External Flows**  
1. **EmotionBand → Band User**  
   - *Flow:* Measures changes in physical parameters (e.g., heart rate).  
   - *Flow:* Notifications and statistics (via Software Application).  
2. **Software Application → Data Storage and Processing Server**  
   - *Flow:* Owner’s anonymized physiological data.  
3. **Data Storage and Processing Server → Software Application**  
   - *Flow:* Updates for emotion recognition model and software.
