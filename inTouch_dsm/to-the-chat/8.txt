### Phase 1: Identify Impact

The incoming change involves adding a "Haptic feedback motor" for real-time emotional state alerts or guided breathing. Let's identify the components that are directly influenced by this change:

1. **Structural support**
   - Reasoning: Adding a haptic feedback motor will require changes to the physical structure to accommodate the new component.

2. **Power management**
   - Reasoning: The haptic feedback motor will need power, thus impacting the power management system.

3. **Computing unit**
   - Reasoning: The computing unit will need to control the haptic feedback motor, requiring changes in software and possibly hardware.

4. **PCB**
   - Reasoning: The PCB will need to be modified to include connections for the haptic feedback motor.

5. **Software application**
   - Reasoning: The software will need to be updated to manage the new functionality of the haptic feedback motor.

### Phase 2: Self-evaluation and Verification

- **Structural support**: Accommodates new physical components directly.
- **Power management**: Powers new motor, direct connection needed.
- **Computing unit**: Controls motor, direct software/hardware update required.
- **PCB**: Connects motor, direct modification needed.
- **Software application**: Manages motor, direct software update required.
