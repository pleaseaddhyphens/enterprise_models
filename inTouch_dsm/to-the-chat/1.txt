### Phase 1: Identify Impact

The incoming change is: "Battery life shall be increased from 1 day to 7 days."

Based on this change, the components that are directly influenced are:

1. **Battery**
   - Reasoning: The battery is the primary component responsible for power storage. Increasing battery life directly affects its specifications and capacity.

2. **PMIC (Power Management Integrated Circuit)**
   - Reasoning: The PMIC manages power distribution and consumption. Changes in battery life require adjustments in power management strategies.

3. **Wireless Charger**
   - Reasoning: With increased battery life, the charging mechanism might need adjustments to handle different charging cycles and power requirements.

### Phase 2: Self-Evaluation and Verification

- **Battery**
  - Verification: Directly impacts battery capacity and specifications. (10 words: "Battery life increase necessitates higher capacity and improved specifications.")

- **PMIC**
  - Verification: Power management must adapt to new battery specifications. (10 words: "PMIC requires adjustments for efficient power management with new battery.")

- **Wireless Charger**
  - Verification: Charging mechanism needs to support new battery requirements. (10 words: "Wireless charger must adapt to new battery charging needs.")
