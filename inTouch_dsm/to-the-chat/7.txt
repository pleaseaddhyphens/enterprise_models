### Phase 1: Identify Impact

1. **Structural Support**
   - **Reasoning**: The addition of an OLED display will require modifications to the housing and possibly the strap to accommodate the new display component.

2. **PCB (Printed Circuit Board)**
   - **Reasoning**: The PCB will need to be redesigned to integrate the new OLED display connections and ensure proper electrical interfacing.

3. **Power Management**
   - **Reasoning**: Adding an OLED display will increase power consumption, necessitating adjustments in power management to ensure efficient battery usage.

4. **Computing Unit**
   - **Reasoning**: The computing unit may need updates to handle the additional data processing and display management tasks associated with the OLED display.

### Phase 2: Self-Evaluation and Verification

- **Structural Support**: Consistent; display addition requires physical accommodation.
- **PCB**: Consistent; new display needs electrical integration.
- **Power Management**: Consistent; displays consume additional power.
- **Computing Unit**: Consistent; additional processing for display management.
