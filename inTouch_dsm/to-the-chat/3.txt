### Phase 1: Identify Impact

The incoming change is: "Charging time shall be reduced from 3 hours to 1 hour (for charging from 0% to 80%)."

Based on the model provided, the components that are directly influenced by this change are:

1. **Wireless Charger**
   - Reasoning: The wireless charger is directly responsible for charging the device. A reduction in charging time would require modifications to the wireless charger to support faster charging.

2. **Battery**
   - Reasoning: The battery must be capable of accepting a faster charge without overheating or degrading. This might require a change in battery technology or specifications.

3. **PMIC (Power Management Integrated Circuit)**
   - Reasoning: The PMIC manages the power flow to and from the battery. It needs to handle the increased power delivery required for faster charging.

### Phase 2: Self-Evaluation and Verification

- **Wireless Charger**: Directly influences charging speed and efficiency.
- **Battery**: Must support faster charging rates without damage.
- **PMIC**: Manages power flow, crucial for faster charging.
