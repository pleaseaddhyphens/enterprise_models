### Phase 1: Identify Impact

Based on the change "The total device weight shall be reduced from 60 grams to 36 grams," the components that are directly influenced are:

1. **Aluminium housing**
   - Reasoning: The housing material and design may need to be modified to reduce weight.

2. **Watch strap**
   - Reasoning: The strap material or design might be adjusted to contribute to weight reduction.

3. **Battery**
   - Reasoning: The battery size or type may need to be changed to a lighter alternative.

4. **Wireless charger**
   - Reasoning: The charger components might need to be optimized or reduced in size/weight.

5. **PCB (Printed Circuit Board)**
   - Reasoning: The PCB design might be optimized or reduced in size to lower weight.

6. **Side buttons**
   - Reasoning: The material or design of the buttons may need to be altered for weight reduction.

### Phase 2: Self-Evaluation and Verification

- **Aluminium housing**: Directly impacted as housing material affects overall weight. Logically consistent.
- **Watch strap**: Directly impacted as strap material affects overall weight. Logically consistent.
- **Battery**: Directly impacted as battery weight is significant in devices. Logically consistent.
- **Wireless charger**: Directly impacted as charger components contribute to weight. Logically consistent.
- **PCB**: Directly impacted as PCB size and material affect weight. Logically consistent.
- **Side buttons**: Directly impacted as button material affects overall weight. Logically consistent.
