### Phase 1: Identify Impact

The incoming change is: "The device shall be water-resistant up to 50 meters."

Components that are directly influenced by this change:

1. **Aluminium housing**
   - Reasoning: The housing must be sealed and robust to withstand water pressure.

2. **Watch strap**
   - Reasoning: The strap must be made of water-resistant material to prevent degradation.

3. **Side buttons**
   - Reasoning: Buttons need to be sealed to prevent water ingress.

4. **PCB (Printed Circuit Board)**
   - Reasoning: The PCB must be coated or designed to prevent water damage.

5. **Wireless charger**
   - Reasoning: Charging contacts need to be sealed to prevent water ingress.

6. **Speaker**
   - Reasoning: Speaker needs to be sealed and possibly redesigned to function underwater.

7. **Microphone**
   - Reasoning: Microphone needs to be sealed and possibly redesigned to function underwater.

8. **Bluetooth**
   - Reasoning: Bluetooth module may need sealing to prevent water damage.

9. **Battery**
   - Reasoning: Battery compartment must be sealed to prevent water ingress.

### Phase 2: Self-evaluation and Verification

- **Aluminium housing**: Directly impacted as it encloses the device.
- **Watch strap**: Must be water-resistant to maintain integrity.
- **Side buttons**: Require sealing to prevent water ingress.
- **PCB**: Needs waterproofing to prevent damage.
- **Wireless charger**: Charging contacts need waterproofing.
- **Speaker**: Needs sealing to prevent water damage.
- **Microphone**: Needs sealing to prevent water damage.
- **Bluetooth**: Requires sealing to prevent water damage.
- **Battery**: Needs sealing to prevent water damage.
