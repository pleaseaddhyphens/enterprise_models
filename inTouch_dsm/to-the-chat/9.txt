### Phase 1: Identify Impact

The incoming change is: "Wireless charging shall be replaced by a wired charging solution."

The components directly influenced by this change are:

1. **Wireless charger**
   - Reasoning: This component will be directly replaced by a wired charging solution.

2. **Power management**
   - Reasoning: The power management subsystem will need adjustments to accommodate the new wired charging method.

3. **Aluminium housing**
   - Reasoning: The housing may need modifications to include a port for wired charging.

4. **Structural support**
   - Reasoning: Structural changes may be required to support the new wired charging port.

### Phase 2: Self-Evaluation and Verification

- **Wireless charger**: Direct replacement by wired charging solution.
- **Power management**: Needs adjustment for new charging method.
- **Aluminium housing**: Requires modification for charging port integration.
- **Structural support**: Needs structural changes for wired charging support.

Each identified impact is logically consistent with the model's architecture, as they involve direct modifications or adjustments due to the change from wireless to wired charging.
