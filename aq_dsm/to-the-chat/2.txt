To conduct an impact analysis of the change request, we need to identify the components that will be directly and indirectly affected by the change in processing speed from 1 tray to 3 trays per 30 seconds.

1st Level of Change:

Belt sub-system

Reasoning: The Belt sub-system is responsible for moving trays. An increase in processing speed will directly impact the Belt sub-system as it needs to handle the increased throughput.

Microcomputer

Reasoning: The Microcomputer is connected to multiple components, including the Detection algorithm, which is crucial for processing images. An increase in processing speed will require faster image processing and decision-making, impacting the Microcomputer's performance.

Camera module

Reasoning: The Camera module captures images of the trays. With an increased processing speed, the Camera module needs to capture images at a faster rate to keep up with the new throughput.
2nd Level of Change:

Detection algorithm

Reasoning: Connected to the Microcomputer, the Detection algorithm will need to process images faster to keep up with the increased speed of the Belt sub-system and the Camera module.

Classification algorithm

Reasoning: Connected to the Detection algorithm, the Classification algorithm will also need to process data faster to maintain the overall system performance.

Power sub-system

Reasoning: With the increased load on the Belt sub-system, Microcomputer, and Camera module, the Power sub-system may need to supply additional power to support the higher operational speed.

Lighting module

Reasoning: Connected to the Microcomputer and Power sub-system, the Lighting module may need adjustments to ensure proper lighting for the faster-moving trays.

Structure

Reasoning: The Structure holds multiple components, including the Belt sub-system and Camera module. Changes in these components may require structural adjustments to accommodate the increased speed and potential vibrations.
