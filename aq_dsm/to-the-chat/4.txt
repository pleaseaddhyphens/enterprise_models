Based on the change request, the power consumption requirement has been reduced from 300 W to 150 W. This change will primarily affect components and subsystems that are directly related to power consumption and management. Here is the analysis:

1st Level of Change:

Power sub-system

Reasoning: The Power sub-system is directly responsible for managing and distributing power to various components. A change in the power consumption requirement will directly impact its design and functionality.

Lighting module

Reasoning: The Lighting module is connected to the Power sub-system. Changes in power requirements will affect the power supply to the lighting, potentially necessitating modifications in the lighting module to operate within the new power constraints.

Microcomputer

Reasoning: The Microcomputer is connected to the Power sub-system and may need adjustments to operate within the new power constraints.

Belt sub-system

Reasoning: The Belt sub-system is connected to the Power sub-system. Changes in power requirements will affect its operation, potentially necessitating modifications to operate within the new power constraints.
2nd Level of Change:

Structure

Reasoning: The Structure is connected to multiple components including the Power sub-system, Lighting module, and Belt sub-system. Changes in these components might necessitate structural adjustments to accommodate modified versions of these components.

Camera module

Reasoning: The Camera module is connected to the Microcomputer. If the Microcomputer requires adjustments due to power changes, the Camera module might also need to be reassessed for compatibility and performance.

Control panel

Reasoning: The Control panel is connected to the Microcomputer. Changes in the Microcomputer due to power adjustments might necessitate updates in the Control panel for proper integration and functionality.
