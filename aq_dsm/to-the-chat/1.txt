1st level of change:

Component: Detection algorithm
Reasoning: The change in accuracy from 80% to 90% directly impacts the Detection algorithm, as it is responsible for identifying objects or features within the images.

Component: Classification algorithm
Reasoning: The Classification algorithm is directly connected to the Detection algorithm. Changes in detection accuracy can influence the classification process, as it relies on the outputs from detection.

2nd level of change:

Component: Microcomputer
Reasoning: The Microcomputer is connected to both the Detection algorithm and the Classification algorithm. Changes in these algorithms may require additional processing power or adjustments in the microcomputer's operations.

Component: Storage
Reasoning: Storage is connected to the Classification algorithm. If the classification process changes, it may require more or different data to be stored, impacting storage needs.

Component: Camera module
Reasoning: The Camera module is connected to the Microcomputer and may need adjustments to capture images that meet the new accuracy requirements.

Final Output:
