            Context_comment: #BACKGROUND:\nPermafrost regions contain numerous natural gas deposits. Pipelines transport gas from extraction sites to end users. The pipeline supports (columns/piles) are subject to displacement due to permafrost thawing thermokarst processes and frost heave which can lead to pipeline deformations and damage.\n\nCurrently pipeline integrity inspections are primarily conducted manually requiring significant time and labor resources. Moreover this approach does not always ensure timely defect detection.\n\nSSTEM PURPOSE:\nMonitoring pipeline deformations using fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors.

    The change request:`Which components will require changes if the sensor polling frequency increases to 1 kHz?`. List the components in the system that could be influenced by that change with the reasoning. Please, be specific! Please, provide only the elements with type Components and Sub-system and System types If they have no children. Please, leave the names of the componetns as they presented in the model. Please, provide at first the components that directly affected by that change, and then components affected by the change of the first set. So, in the intermediate answer I expect 1st level of change and then 2nd level of change caused by 1st level changes. After that provide the final output with format provided in Final Output Example with ONLY 1st level of changes
    Final Output Example:
    &&&
    Component: <component_name>  
    Reasoning: <reasoning_text>  

    Component: <component_name>  
    Reasoning: <reasoning_text>
