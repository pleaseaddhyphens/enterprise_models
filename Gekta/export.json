            Context_comment: #BACKGROUND:\nModern molecular biology laboratories carry out more than 5000 reactions a day. Each sample moves through a tightly controlled pipelineâ€”from extraction and amplification to sequencing and interpretation. Mainly this routine operation conducted by human. Labor shortage push the technology to automate these porcesses.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo develop automated versitile system to conduct the RPR reactions. \n\n\n\n
