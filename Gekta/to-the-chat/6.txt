To conduct an impact analysis of the change request regarding the required accuracy of automated reaction product detection, we need to identify the components that are directly and indirectly affected by this change.

### Intermediate Answer

#### 1st Level of Change
1. **Component: RPR reaction analyzer**
   - **Reasoning:** This component is directly responsible for analyzing the product of the RPR reaction and making judgments. Increasing the required accuracy will necessitate modifications to the computer vision algorithm to achieve higher precision in detection.

2. **Component: Software**
   - **Reasoning:** The software controls the CNC unit and analyzes reaction results. Changes to the accuracy requirements will impact the overall software logic, particularly in how it processes and interprets data from the RPR reaction analyzer.

3. **Component: Database**
   - **Reasoning:** The database stores sample data and analysis results. With increased accuracy requirements, the data structure or storage mechanism might need adjustments to handle more precise or additional data points.

#### 2nd Level of Change
1. **Component: Data base interaction module**
   - **Reasoning:** This module interacts with the database to get patient IDs and assign analysis results. Changes in the database structure or data handling necessitated by the accuracy change will require updates to this module to ensure compatibility and correct data processing.

2. **Component: CNC and pump control algorithm**
   - **Reasoning:** If the software controlling the CNC unit needs adjustments due to changes in the RPR reaction analyzer, the control algorithms for the CNC and pump might also need fine-tuning to ensure the physical process aligns with the new accuracy requirements.

3. **Component: Alarm sub-system**
   - **Reasoning:** With higher accuracy requirements, the conditions under which alarms are triggered might need reevaluation. This could involve recalibrating the thresholds for alerts to match the new accuracy standards.
